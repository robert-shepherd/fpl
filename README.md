# Predicting Fantasy Premier League scores
Creating a model to predict Fantasy Premier League player scores and a dashboard for users to identify high scoring players for their team

This project aims to augment userâ€™s ability to select the best possible FPL team by developing:
1.	A model that predicts number of points scored for each FPL player in each of their upcoming games
2.	A dashboard that allows users to interact with the prediction data and identify players that would fit in to their team given a set of constraints

Below shows an overview of each script and its purpose.
